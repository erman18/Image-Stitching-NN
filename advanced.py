class HistoryCheckpoint(Callback):
    '''Callback that records events
        into a `History` object.

        It then saves the history after each epoch into a file.
        To read the file into a python dict:
            history = {}
            with open(filename, "r") as f:
                history = eval(f.read())

        This may be unsafe since eval() will evaluate any string
        A safer alternative:

        import ast

        history = {}
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            history = ast.literal_eval(f.read())
